/**
 * The `StagehandExtractHandler` class is responsible for extracting structured data from a webpage.
 * It provides two approaches: `textExtract` and `domExtract`. `textExtract` is used by default.
 *
 * Here is what `textExtract` does at a high level:
 *
 * **1. Wait for the DOM to settle and start DOM debugging.**
 *    - Ensures the page is fully loaded and stable before extraction.
 *
 * **2. Store the original DOM before any mutations.**
 *    - Preserves the initial state of the DOM to restore later.
 *    - We do this because creating spans around every word in the DOM (see step 4)
 *      becomes very difficult to revert. Text nodes can be finicky, and directly
 *      removing the added spans often corrupts the structure of the DOM.
 *
 * **3. Process the DOM to generate a selector map of candidate elements.**
 *    - Identifies potential elements that contain the data to extract.
 *
 * **4. Create text bounding boxes around every word in the webpage.**
 *    - Wraps words in spans so that their bounding boxes can be used to
 *      determine their positions on the text-rendered-webpage.
 *
 * **5. Collect all text annotations (with positions and dimensions) from each of the candidate elements.**
 *    - Gathers text and positional data for each word.
 *
 * **6. Group annotations by text and deduplicate them based on proximity.**
 *    - There is no guarantee that the text annotations are unique (candidate elements can be nested).
 *    - Thus, we must remove duplicate words that are close to each other on the page.
 *
 * **7. Restore the original DOM after mutations.**
 *    - Returns the DOM to its original state after processing.
 *
 * **8. Format the deduplicated annotations into a text representation.**
 *    - Prepares the text data for the extraction process.
 *
 * **9. Pass the formatted text to an LLM for extraction according to the given instruction and schema.**
 *    - Uses a language model to extract structured data based on instructions.
 *
 * **10. Handle the extraction response and logging the results.**
 *     - Processes the output from the LLM and logs relevant information.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Each step corresponds to specific code segments, as noted in the comments throughout the code.
