Certainly ‚Äî here‚Äôs a file context you can drop into index.ts (or a separate README.md / Cursor context window) to guide development across your MVP system:

üìÑ File Context: index.ts (Automation Feasibility MVP Runner)

This file orchestrates the full MVP automation loop for evaluating browser-based BAU workflows using Browserbase.

It performs the following steps:
	1.	Record Session (recorder/recordSession.ts)
	‚Ä¢	Launches a Browserbase instance and records a user manually completing a BAU task (e.g., copying data from a dashboard to a Google Sheet).
	‚Ä¢	Saves the session log (e.g., as JSON or HAR) to data/sessionLogs/.
	2.	Replay Session (replayer/replaySession.ts)
	‚Ä¢	Loads the saved recording and replays it in a sandboxed browser environment using Browserbase.
	‚Ä¢	Captures the end DOM state, console logs, network activity, and any errors.
	3.	Validate Outcome (replayer/validateReplay.ts)
	‚Ä¢	Compares the replayed session‚Äôs result against a saved expected output (e.g., specific DOM structure, spreadsheet cell contents).
	‚Ä¢	Logs discrepancies or unexpected behavior.
	4.	Classify Feasibility (automation/classifyAutomation.ts)
	‚Ä¢	Applies heuristics (DOM diff, page transitions, modal appearances, field stability) to decide if the task is:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Automatable
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Automatable
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Non-Automatable
	‚Ä¢	Stores result as a tagged report for further analysis.
	5.	Future Hook (automation/parametrizeTask.ts)
	‚Ä¢	(Planned) Inject custom data or input parameters into replays to make task templates reusable.

All actions, diffs, and logs are saved for traceability. This system is intended to bootstrap a library of reusable browser task automations that can be generalized, rerun, and monitored at scale.
